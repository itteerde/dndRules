You conjure spirits from the Elemental Planes that flit around you in a 15-foot Emanation for the duration. Until the spell ends, any attack you make while using Wild Shape or with a Spell Attack from a spell found on the Druid Spell List deals an extra 2d8 damage when you hit a creature in the Emanation. This damage is Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning (your choice when you make the attack).

In addition, the ground in the Emanation is Difficult Terrain for your enemies.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 2d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
