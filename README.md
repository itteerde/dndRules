Rules Stuff for DnD, mostly clarifications, QaA
- [Table-Rules](https://github.com/itteerde/dndRules/wiki/Table-Rules)


# Spellcasting
- There is no general rule against maintaining Concentration across different Planes. [Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/can-you-concentrate-on-a-spell-whose-active-effects-are-on-an-other-plane-of-existence/)


# Spells

## Counterspell
- needs that `you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell`. [Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/do-you-need-line-of-sight-to-cast-counterspell-on-a-creature/) It is in the spell's casting time/ Reaction condition asterix.
- cannot be used if you casted a Spell using a Bonus Action [Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/bonus-action-spell-reaction-spell/) [PHB](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#BonusAction).

## Forcecage
- **Ruling:** The cage variant provides 3/4 cover from stuff that is not obviously to wide to go through.
- As the general rules for [Spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Targets) only require a path, that not requiring any minimum dimensions, AoE can be put on the other side of the cage variant without additional limitations.

## Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
- **Ruling:** The sphere is opaque and blocks sound.

## Wall of Force
- As the general rules for [Spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Targets) require a `clear path to it, so it canâ€™t be behind total cover` for anything that has to pick a target (though not being clear if that requires the word `target` in the rule, except for the origin point for AoE, where it is always targeting) most Spells do not work *through* the wall. This means no AoE that does not have a special clause (think there is none) can be casted *through* the wall.
- [Dimension Door](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dimension-door) is unaffected, just works.
- [Misty Step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step) does work, there is clear Sage Advice answering just this question. ( [sage advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/targeting-spellsclear-path-can-i-target-across-wall-of-force/) )
- [Scatter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scatter) cannot pick any of the `targets` to be on the other side, but the destinations can be *through* the wall.
- [Vortex Warp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/vortex-warp) cannot pick a `target` on the opposite side of the wall from the Caster, but allow to pick any side of the wall as the destination.
