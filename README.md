Rules Stuff for DnD, mostly clarifications, QaA

# Wall of Force
- As the general rules for Spellcasting require a `line of effect` for anything that has to pick a target (though not being clear if that requires the word `target` in the rule, except for the origin point for AoE, where it is always targeting) most Spells do not work *trough* the wall. This means no AoE that does not have a special clause (think there is none) can be casted *through* the wall.
- Dimension Door is unaffected, just works.
- Misty Step does work, there is clear Sage Advice answering just this question.
- Vortex Warp cannot pick a `target` on the opposite side of the wall from the Caster, but allow to pick any side of the wall as the destination.
