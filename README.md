# Definitions

## Magical Effects/ magical
- [Sage Advice](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/SA-Compendium.pdf)
  ```txt
  Determining whether a game feature is magical is straightforward. Ask yourself these questions about the feature:
  - Is it a magic item?
  - Is it a spell? Or does it let you create the effects of a spell that's mentioned in its description?
  - Is it a spell attack?
  - Is it fueled by the use of spell slots?
  - Does the description say it's magical?
  If your answer to any of those questions is yes, the feature is magical. [...] Cold Breath [a dragon's breath weapon] is not considered a magical game effect.
  ```
  **Note:** This is either not covering or unsatisfactory in combination with some of the newer stats blocks that closely replicate spells (like new Wizards, e.g. [Evoker Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm/bestiary-vz#EvokerWizard), note that both with CoP and Magical Resistance it only matters for Saves, so the Spell Attack criterion from the Sage Advice never apllies) renamed and without referring to the spell. Note that the sage advice is older than those new type stat blocks.
- [Circle of Power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/circle-of-power) refers to `spells and other magical effects`.

# Spellcasting
- There is no general rule against maintaining Concentration across different Planes. [Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/can-you-concentrate-on-a-spell-whose-active-effects-are-on-an-other-plane-of-existence/)


# Spells

## Counterspell
- needs that `you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell`. [Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/do-you-need-line-of-sight-to-cast-counterspell-on-a-creature/) It is in the spell's casting time/ Reaction condition asterix.
- cannot be used if you casted a Spell using a Bonus Action [Sage Advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/bonus-action-spell-reaction-spell/) [PHB](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#BonusAction).

## Forcecage
- **Ruling:** The cage variant provides 3/4 cover from stuff that is not obviously to wide to go through.
- As the general rules for [Spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Targets) only require a path, that not requiring any minimum dimensions, AoE can be put on the other side of the cage variant without additional limitations.

## Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
- **Ruling:** The sphere is opaque and blocks sound.

## Wall of Force
- As the general rules for [Spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#Targets) require a `clear path to it, so it canâ€™t be behind total cover` for anything that has to pick a target (though not being clear if that requires the word `target` in the rule, except for the origin point for AoE, where it is always targeting) most Spells do not work *through* the wall. This means no AoE that does not have a special clause (think there is none) can be casted *through* the wall.
- [Dimension Door](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dimension-door) is unaffected, just works.
- [Misty Step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step) does work, there is clear Sage Advice answering just this question. ( [sage advice](https://www.sageadvice.eu/targeting-spellsclear-path-can-i-target-across-wall-of-force/) )
- [Scatter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scatter) cannot pick any of the `targets` to be on the other side, but the destinations can be *through* the wall.
- [Vortex Warp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/vortex-warp) cannot pick a `target` on the opposite side of the wall from the Caster, but allow to pick any side of the wall as the destination.


# X-Cases

## Death Ward and Necrotic Husk
- **Question:** If you have a [Death Ward](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/death-ward) on you and have a Reaction, being an Undead Warlock of level 10+, can you choose to use your [Necrotic Husk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock#TheUndead) instead of the  [Death Ward](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/death-ward) going off if you would be reduced to 0 hit points by damage?
