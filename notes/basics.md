# Assumptions
1. The `Adventuring Day` is in play. The majority of sequences between `Long Rest` has either 0 or 4+ resource consuming encounters, regularly having 4+ combat encounters before `Long Rest`.\
    \
    Without a regular resource draining `Adventuring Day` once full `Spellcasters` get strong and efficient `Concentration` `Spells` they dominate the game in an unhealthy way. If the number of times they can do that is lower than the number of encounters per day this problem disappears, being replaced on some degree of different responsibilities, with some `Classes`, where one combat per `Long Rest` leads to just unloading everything all the time -- usually the same way, like having "a rotation" in some computer games.
